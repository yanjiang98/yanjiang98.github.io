[PowerRadio: Manipulate Sensor Measurement via Power GND Radiation](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss-paper/powerradio-manipulate-sensor-measurement-via-power-gnd-radiation/)

**Yan Jiang**, Xiaoyu Ji, Yancheng Jiang, Kai Wang, Chenren Xu, Wenyuan Xu

<!-- [**Code**](https://github.com/lin000001/Legilimens) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong> -->
- In this paper, we open up a new threat vector to sensor measurements. Specifically, we explore the energy conversion of wired signals, and design a power cable-based sensor manipulation attack, named "PowerRadio". PowerRadio can tamper with sensors' readings across sockets and household wiring system.

[Marionette: Manipulate Your Touchscreen via a Charging Cable](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10288382)

**Yan Jiang**, Xiaoyu Ji, Kai Wang, Chen Yan, Richard Mitev, Ahmad-Reza Sadeghi, Wenyuan Xu

- In this paper, we study the effective detection and protection methods for common-mode (CM) signal injection attacks. In particular, we propose an active suppression device named "GhostBlocker" based on a three -phase common-mode inductor, which enables designers to effectively detect and filter out common-mode interference signals.

[Capspeaker: Injecting Commands to Voice Assistant via Capacitors](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10288392)

**Yan Jiang**, Xiaoyu Ji, Juchuan Zhang, Yancheng Jiang, Shui Jiang, Wenyuan Xu

- In this paper, we provide a more comprehensive exploration of "Capspeaker" potential threats and implications. We design a nonlinear model for optimizing the signal crafting process, which significantly improves the recognition success rate of voice assistants. Secondly, we propose a novel software-level defense mechanism that can distinguish malicious and legitimate voice commands. Finally, we expand the attack scenraios applicable to the Capspeaker.

[WIGHT: Wired Ghost Touch Attack on Capacitive Touchscreens](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9833740)

**Yan Jiang**, Xiaoyu Ji, Kai Wang, Chen Yan, Richard Mitev, Ahmad-Reza Sadeghi, Wenyuan Xu

- In this paper, we reveal for the first time that the capacitive touchscreens on mobile devices like smartphone, tablet and GPS can be remotely manipulated via power cables. We presenst a practical attack named "WIGHT", which can inject fake touches, alter users' touch operations and disable the touchscreen. We verified the feasibility of WIGHT on touchscreen panels and commercial devices of brands like Apple, Huawei and Xiaomi.

[SoK: Understanding the Fundamentals and Implications of Sensor Out-of-band Vulnerabilities](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2026-s450-paper.pdf)

Shilin Xiao, Wenjun Zhu, **Yan Jiang**, Kai Wang, Peiwang Wang, Chen Yan, Xiaoyu Ji, Wenyuan Xu

- In this paper, we propose a sensor out-of-band (OOB) vulnerability framework that systematically abstracts sensor attack surfaces from a physical perspective. Using a bottom-up approach, we analyze vulnerabilities at the component, sensor, and system levels, and provide insights for improving sensor and CPS security.

- In this paper, we explore a new attack surface of SRSs by presenting an enrollment-phase attack paradigm, named FenceSitter, where the adversary poisons the SRS using imperceptible adversarial ambient sound when the legitimate user registers into the SRS.
