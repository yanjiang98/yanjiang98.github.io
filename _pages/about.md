<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a final-year Ph.D. student at Zhejiang University (ZJU). I obtained my B.E. degree in 2020 from Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications.

<!-- will soon be joining the Independent Cyber Security Lab (ICSL) at Huawei, having been selected for the "[Top Minds](https://career.huawei.com/reccampportal/portal5/topminds.html)" program. -->

<!-- I obtained my Ph.D. in 2024 and my B.Eng. in 2019 from the College of Electrical Engineering at Zhejiang University, and I currently work as a security researcher. -->

My doctoral research is under the guidance of <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FCsdj0YAAAAJ'>Prof. Wenyuan Xu</a> and <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=9D4UYBoAAAAJ'>Prof. Xiaoyu Ji</a> at ZJU. Recently, my research interests involve around IoT security, with a particular focus on the sensor & algorithm security, malicious power and hardware security. I have contributed to several publications in leading security conferences and journals such as IEEE S&P, NDSS, ICASSP, and TDSC.


<!-- I successfully defended my Ph.D. thesis. My research interests revolve around AI (for) security and privacy, with a particular focus on the security and safety of (multimodal) large language models (LLMs) recently. I have contributed to several publications in leading security conferences such as IEEE S&P, USENIX Security, ACM CCS, and NDSS. I am open to academic collaborations and welcome discussions regarding potential research partnerships. -->

[PowerRadio: Manipulate Sensor Measurement via Power GND Radiation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18103)

**Yan Jiang**, Xiaoyu Ji, Yancheng Jiang, Kai Wang, Chenren Xu, Wenyuan Xu

<!-- [**Code**](https://github.com/lin000001/Legilimens) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong> -->
- In this paper, we reveal for the first time that the capacitive touchscreens on mobile devices like smartphone, tablet and GPS can be remotely manipulated via power cables. We presenst a practical attack named "WIGHT", which can inject fake touches, alter users' touch operations and disable the touchscreen. We verified the feasibility of WIGHT on touchscreen panels and commercial devices of brands like Apple, Huawei and Xiaomi.

[Legilimens: Practical and Unified Content Moderation for Large Language Model Services](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15488)

Jialin Wu, **Jiangyi Deng** (co-first), Shengyuan Pang, Yanjiao Chen, Jiayang Xu, Xinfeng Li, Wenyuan Xu

[**Code**](https://github.com/lin000001/Legilimens) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- In this paper, we reveal for the first time that effective and efficient content moderation can be achieved by extracting conceptual features from chat-oriented LLMs, despite their initial fine-tuning for conversation rather than content moderation. We propose a practical and unified content moderation framework for LLM services, named Legilimens, which features both effectiveness and efficiency.

[SOPHON: Non-Fine-Tunable Learning to Restrain Task Transferability For Pre-trained Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12699)

**Jiangyi Deng**, Shengyuan Pang, Yanjiao Chen, Liangming Xia, Yijie Bai, Haiqin Weng, Wenyuan Xu

[**Code**](https://github.com/ChiangE/Sophon) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- In this paper, we introduce a pioneering learning paradigm, *non-fine-tunable learning*, which prevents the pre-trained model from being fine-tuned to indecent tasks while preserving its performance on the original task.
